# The C programming language exercise solutions
This repository holds my[^1] solutions for the exercises in The C programming language, Second Edition ANSI C (ISBN-10 0131103628 or 0131103709)[^2]
These solutions are written as a beginner working through the book so they are solved with the mindset and tools available at that point in the book.
It's is done solely as a progression counter for myself and so I can look back at it and compare my progress in the future.
